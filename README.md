# anagram-solver
## Idea:
My passion for NYT's _Spangram_ game has given me an idea for an anagram solver that I can run locally in order to find the words that I really cannot find or I do not know. I wanted it to be as basic as possible, while at the same time to serve its purpose.

In order to be able to use the English dictionary, I used [matthewreagans's compact dictionary](https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary/blob/master/dictionary_compact.json") and for the server I wrote a short python script using Flask. 

I really hope it comes in handy to people like me and I look forward to expanding it with other functionalities in the future.
